Simple e-commerce shop with Spring Boot and MySQL (CRUD app).

##Technologies I used

* Spring Boot
* Spring Security
* MySQL
* JPA and Hibernate
* TomCat

##What works now...

* User log in and register
* Admin panel for categories
* Displaying, adding, updating and removing categories in admin panel.

##... and what is to be done:

* CRUD operations for products (for admin).
* Displaying products for clients
* Cart
* Orders


All passwords in configuration files are just for example. :)
